Hi everyone,

Thanks for coming to the tutorial yesterday. I am writing to point you towards the slides and example from class, and to make sure that you have contact information for me and the Research Computing Services team in case you need some help in the future.

You can find the slides and worked example at the link below. The "MATLAB Parallel Computing Toolbox" materials are the second item in the "High Performance Computing Tutorials" section.
